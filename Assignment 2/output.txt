Title : For Sale: Remington Sportsman 58 SX Sun-Grain Skeet 20 Gauge Shotgun Collector Grade Gold Inlay
Keywords : Shotgun,Semi-automatic,20 Gauge
Content : Up for sale is a very unique and beautiful, Collector Grade, Remington Sportsman 58 SX with Sun-grain maple stocks. With factory original Skeet barrel. While most Remington 58s are engraved on both sides of the receiver, this upgraded shotgun also has the original gold inlay. In addition, this skeet model has a different comb than the standard grade and includes the Cutts compensator with original chokes, including the sought after scatter choke.  This firearm has been well cared for, it has no cracks or gouges in the furniture. Included is the original paperwork from the 1960s and 1970s for small parts/repairs. This shotgun recently was gone through by a Remington Armor / Gunsmith and it functions flawlessly. The shotgun is vent-rib barrel and dual bead sight.  It is an excellent clay crushing precision shotgun, with the accessories to get you out hunting. This shotgun has taken a lot of Doves and Quails.  Here is some background on the 58: The model 58, sometimes referred to as the Sportsman 58, was the first gas operated Remington shotgun. It was introduced in 1956, discontinued in 1963. It used basically the receiver section of the 870, a modified 870 barrel, and somewhat the marriage of the action slide/forend system of a 11-48 recoil operated gun, converted to make it gas operation. The Remington 58 was made in 12, 16 and 20ga 2 3/4" chambering plus a separate 12 ga 3" magnum version. The barrel sported a ventilated rib, with no plain barrels supplied. This model only holds 2 rounds in the magazine as the recoil spring is inside the forward end of this tube. The gas system was not self regulating but required the shooter to adjust the regulator to match the loads used. This regulator also acts as a magazine cap has a Hi and a Low setting. This is regulated by twisting the end cap to where the marks line up for Hi or Low. This means that if you are using a "trap load", your should use a Low setting, where a heavy duck load is used the Hi setting would be more appropriate.  Since the complete rear section and receiver were 870 origin, therefore firing pins, extractors, extractor spring and plungers and many of the trigger group parts are the same as for the current model 870. Operating handles are the same as the model 1100 or the newer 11-87. Much of the trigger group will be the same as the 1100. Buttstocks off an 870 will fit as well as the stock bolt and washer. Forearms will be a problem to find, as any of the newer models do not interchange. And used 58 forearms come at a premium price.  Since I can only upload 3 Pictures, here is a link to several more of this fine shotgun. http://s1381.photobucket.com/user/Riggo/library/Remington%2058 $700.00 OBO   This shotgun is from my Private Collection, I am the original purchaser. FTF or I am willing to ship to your FFL Sorry No Trades Please only Respectable Offers only.  Thanks for looking. Email works best for me.

Title : For Sale: The BEST firearms training for the most INSANE bang for the buck!
Keywords : N/A
Content : I just got word that FOR A LIMITED TIME ONLY I was given the chance to hand out 5 Diamond Memberships for the Front Sight training facility in Las Vegas with a TON OF BONUSES that no entry level member will ever be able to get!  Not only is Front Sight the biggest provider for high-quality firearms training with more than 28 (!) gun ranges on their grounds, but you will learn to gain more skills than most law enforcement or even some military personnel have!  That's not the greatest part about this, though! Your Diamond Membership will actually be FOR LIFE! That means that you will be able to return and take courses as often as you wish! Yes, if the classes have availability, you could stay there a full month and go through everything they offer without paying a penny more!  Beside their Defensive Handgun, Defensive Shotgun, Rifle and Submachine Gun classes, they also offer an Empty Hand Combat class and a Rappeling class or even some kids classes, with more stuff to come! Again, ALL of these classes will be open to you for $250. That is a ONE-TIME fee you will never be paying again, because you are now a preferred life-time member! When you are in, you are in!  Now, here is where it gets really exciting! I do have some BONUSES for the first 4 people ONLY!  Once you sign up and paid the $250 dollars, you will get the following!  5 Certificates good for a Two Day Handgun, Shotgun or Rifle Course... (Transferable to ANY of your friends or family. HECK, if you wish you can sell 'em and make your money right back!)  5 Certificates good for a Four Day Handgun, Shotgun or Rifle Course... (Transferable to ANY of your friends or family. Yup, this stuff as well...SELL them and make you money right back! You now got all of this for free! I have not believed it myself until I actually invested in this and went to a class.)  2 Free Gun Rental Certificates...  10 Diamond Lifetime Memberships to sell or transfer to any non-member you wish...  So, here is the deal! If you get ONE other person to come with you to a course and they buy a Diamond membership from you! You will have made your money back and you have now basically become a life-time member for FREE! I know, it is insane! But as long as these guys are still able to offer these incredible memberships, it would be outright stupid to not take advantage of it. Considering that most single handgun trainings are already costing double of the membership price.  Like I mentioned, the first 4 will get the BONUS stuff! After that, I will still be giving out the memberships, but without the BONUS certificates, etc.  So, really....this is a no-brainer! It's $250! So, don't waste time. Send me an email and we can get you signed up today!  I will take this offer down as soon as I get word from Front Sight, because quite honestly, they will pull this very soon, since they are doing this to get the last bit of money for the resort they are currently building! Yes, you heard right! Soon you will be able to go to Front Sight, do your firearms training, walk down to the resort, jump in the pool and have a great dinner!  And in the meantime, if you are really quick, I am actually going out there with a couple of friends in April! So, you could join us for that as well!  Alright, enough said. If you don't send me an email right now and get this set up, I honestly cannot help you. You are too good at talking yourself out of a good thing!  I'll talk to you later!  Patrick

Title : For Sale: H&amp;K USP 40 S&amp;W V1
Keywords : Double / Single Action,Pistol,40 cal
Content : H&K USP 40 S&W DA/SA with decocker on left size (V1). It includes 2 Mag, night sights, and gun lock. It has low usage, low round count. It is in excellent condition. It has spend most of the time in storage. Gun is very accurate and reliable. No trades, for sale only. I will ask for ID and will have a bill of sale. Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol. All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols. All major metal components on the USP are corrosion-resistant. Outside metal surfaces are protected by H&Ks proprietary hostile environment nitride finish. Internal metal parts are coated with a Dow Corning anti-corrosion chemical to reduce friction and wear. The gunmaker tested the MK23s recoil system with over 30k rounds of +P ammunition followed by 6k high pressure proof rounds. After disassembling the gun the Germans found no damage or excessive wear to any of the components.  And then they did some more tests . . .  The ballistic boffins froze the USP to 42 C (43.5 F), fired it and then frozen it again. They heated it to 67 C (152.6 F) and fired it. They cycled between these extremes several times. They subjected USP to standard NATO mud and rain abuse. They immersed it in water and sprayed it with sea water. They dropped it from six feet, hammer first, onto a steel-backed concrete slab.(http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2012/09/jim-barrett/gun-review-hk-usp-tactical-45/)

Title : For Sale/Trade: Complete Black Cav Arms Lower With CMMG 18&quot; SPR Upper
Keywords : N/A
Content : The lower is a new Cavalry Arms polymer lower made by GWACS Armory. It is black, built with a PSA lower kit. If you have any concern about a polymer lower, GWACS covers the lower for any damage you may do to it for $35 plus shipping. These are the orignal polymer lower, not cheap knock offs that made their way around during the last craze.   The mag release button has been upgraded to a Seekins Precision one. The buffer spring is a CS heavy duty with a Slash Heavy buffer. These make the gun flat shooting with very low recoil.  The only wear on the gun is on the take down pins and the bolt release. The bolt release is a bit discolored from some old tan paint, it is a used Wilson Combat over-sized version, but it is missing the bolt on piece to make it oversized, so it is just a normal release. The pins have the finish worn off from taking the gun apart.   It only has 20 rounds through it for testing.   The Upper is a like new CMMG 18" SPR profiled upper. It is mid-length with a 1/8 twist barrel chambered for 5.56. It has pinned and cut FSB under a YHM Rifle Length Light Weight Free Floating hand guard. The lock nut on the rail has been banged up a bit, nothing that affects its reliability, just cosmetic. The BCG is from Ares Arms, just a standard full auto mil spec BCG. The Flash Suppressor is a Rainier Arms XTC. The barrel has been painted foliage green. It has less than 100 rounds through it.   Looking to get $750 complete  I will take cash or discrete pay pal gift or Amazon Transfer. I will also ship on the buyers dime to your FFL that accepts individual transfers. I can provide feedback from other online trading sites to online buyers.   Trades are listed below.

Title : For Sale: Factory Wilson Combat 6.8SPC Recon Hunter LMT PRI
Keywords : Semi-automatic,6.8mm SPCII,Rifle
Content : Like New factory built Wilson Combat 6.8 spc complete Armour coat finish with 3 new 30rd PRI mags, 1-15rd & 1-10rd PRI mag, original WCR case. Upgrades include Geissle SuperDynamic Combat, LMT SOPMOD stock and LMT grip with BCM gunfighter charging handle and Knight Armament flip up rear sight . I have put 20 rounds thru it one round at a time and a clean to break the barrel in. I have put a box Hornady 120sst sighting in and 3 shot groups were around .5 inch. Shot the Wilson and Tavor to confirm 100yd zero before a hunt and the 2 in the red where from this Wilson rifle it's a tac driver. This gun is in like new condition not a mark on it and clean inside and out. This rifle is solid and versital for Hogs or SHTF. I found all the specs and will paste them to help with any questions. You wont see these come up for sale very often and probably never in this condition. Check my feedback I am honest and try very hard to make things go smoothly for both parties.********** Wilson Combat Tactical Lightweight Hunter AR-15 Rifle in 6.8 SPC After a tremendous amount of research and testing by Bill Wilson and the Wilson Combat team we are excited to announce the availability of our custom AR platform rifles chambered in 6.8 SPC caliber. The 6.8 SPC (6.8x43mm) was initially developed by MSG Steve Holland and Chris Murray a United States Army Marksmanship Unit gunsmith to offer superior downrange lethality over the 5.56 NATO/.223 Remington in an AR pattern service rifle with minimal loss of magazine capacity and a negligible increase in recoil. When built to the level of quality and precision Wilson Combat has achieved the 6.8 SPC is also capable of outstanding accuracy and reliability. In our match-grade, Spec II chambered 16 barrels, The 6.8 SPC is capable of pushing a .277 caliber, 85gr bullet to over 2900 FPS. 110gr bullets easily achieve 2500 FPS with factory loaded ammunition. Appropriate hand loading can achieve even higher velocities and enable the use of heavier projectiles up to 130 grains, which dramatically improves terminal ballistics over a 5.56 Nato/.223 Remington at long range. This added ballistic performance makes the 6.8 SPC perfect for home protection and SRT/SWAT teams. The 6.8 is a truly ideal hunting round for medium to heavy game and turns the AR into a serious hunting rifle. Features: Wilson Combat forged 7075 flat top upper receiver, marked 6.8 SPC II Wilson Combat forged 7075 lower receiver Stainless lightweight match grade barrel with 4 groove / 1-11 twist, SPC II chamber, M4 feedramps, 16 Mid-length gas system, with lo profile gas block LMT enhanced bolt and carrier with NP3 coating Wilson Combat quadrail Wilson Combat Accu-Tac flash hider, 5/8-24 Wilson Combat single stage TTU (tactical trigger unit) approx 4# pull MAGPUL CTR butt stock and MOE pistol grip with tactical trigger guard Armor Tuff polymer finish in black One Precision Reflex 30 round magazine Wilson Combat nylon assault case Caliber 6.8mm SPC Capacity 21-29 Barrel Length 16 inches Action Type Semi-Auto Stock Material Polymer Stock Adjustable Weight (unloaded) 7 lbs Sights No Scope Rails Yes Optics Included No Finish Best Designed For: Hunting Target Tactical Price: $2,450.00

Brass is prepared using the following process: 1) Wet tumbled using steel pin media 2) De-primed and resized using Dillon Precision dies and a Dillon XL650 progressive press. 3) Wet tumbled once again to achieve that "new brass" finish inside and out and also have crystal clean primer pockets.  Note: I no longer trim rifle brass, except where noted, having buyers indicate they prefer to trim to their own specifications.  All efforts are made to eliminate any pieces of brass with case mouth damage, cracks and split cases, but you should always perform your own inspection.  I would not sell them to you if I would not use them for my own personal reloading. What you will receive will be the outer cases with the super clean interiors unlike what many others will provide (the inner group of darker cases). Why buy half clean cases?

Title : For Sale: 1871 Johnson &amp; Bye .22 Short (black powder) TYCOON
Keywords : N/A
Content : This is a Tycoon pocket pistol made in 1871 by Johnson & Bye. I have seen 10 or so Tycoons in the past 50 years, and surprisingly, everyone was in sound condition. That's odd, considering they were heavily sold as vest pocket pistols in that era. They seem to be exceptionally well made. This is not a firearm under Federal law, but it can only be shipped to locales where it would be legal. That lets out the usual list, like California, Mass., New Jersey, Illinois, New York, etc. It is for black powder only and use of conventional .22 shorts can rupture the cylinder and be dangerous.

Title : For Sale: H&amp;K, HECKLER &amp; KOCH MR556A1 556 NATO **NEW IN BOX** 3 MAGS
Keywords : 223/5.56 NATO,Semi-automatic,Rifle
Content : Up for sale is brand new in case never fired HECKLER &amp; KOCH MR556A1 556 NATO **NEW IN BOX** 3 MAGS Call or text Joe @ (602) 3 six one 7 2 seven 3 or email newguns518@gmail.com Heckler &amp; Koch MR556A1 556 Nato **NEW IN BOX** A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler &amp; Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm with match rifle capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles. The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating &ldquo;pusher&rdquo; rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers. The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 &ldquo;Picatinny&rdquo; rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems. Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler &amp; Koch&rsquo;s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life. But unlike the HK416, the MR556A1 does not use a chrome-lined barrel. Chrome-lining can sometimes mask bore imperfections and negatively affect accuracy. For the new series of Heckler &amp; Koch semi-automatic MR rifles, HK designers and engineers believe best accuracy comes with an unlined bore. Used with the HK Free Floating Rail System, the barrel does not touch the handguard, ensuring the barrel is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy. The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately &ldquo;swagged&rdquo; with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5-inch MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy. A precise enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the MR556A1 and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle takedown pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance. Designed to function with a wide variety of high quality 5.56 x 45 mm ammunition, the MR556A1 uses a C.I.P. dimensioned chamber (a chamber with dimensions specified by the Commission Internationale Permanente).The MR556A1 also functions reliably with most quality Caliber .223 Remington ammunition. The MR556A1 is being produced with the same commitment to quality as German-made HK firearms. By using joint U.S./German manufacturing, Heckler &amp; Koch leverages the relative strengths of two continents to make the preeminent AR-type firearm, combining the designs innovations of the USA and Germany into one new product.

Title : For Sale/Trade: Colt Defender SS Ceraokote 9mm Special Edition FS/FT
Keywords : Single Action,9mm Luger,Pistol
Content : Colt Defender SS Ceraokote/Black ion bond finish direct from colt  Wood grips came from Colt on the gun as it's a special edition fire arm from Colt. Caliber : 9mm 2x8 round magazines that came with it Original box/accessories  No ammo included. Just the gun.  Has about 10 mags through it "80 rounds" So it has never been field stripped as of yet for a thorough cleaning.  Mod # 07002DSE  This is a special edition pistol and you will not find it in your mom and pop gun shops.  I paid $1200 out the door in cash so this isn't for those with light pockets.  Price is $900 firm cash or trade plus cash  Nick 850-240-4993 texts preferred

Title : For Sale: LNIB HK USP 40 Full Size
Keywords : Double / Single Action,Pistol,40 S&amp;W
Content : HK USP 40 variant 1 with decocker and safety. Cocked and locked carry capability 1911 style as well as hammer down in standard double action / single action mode. Very versatile gun with a comfortable, non slip grip, large trigger guard to enable gloved use, ambidextrous mag release, and a perfect 1911 grip angle for natural pointing. Large and very easy to see big white dot sights. This is one of the very early and rare versions, bought new in 1993, it has some unique features not found on 1994+ versions such as conventional rifling (allowing lead cast ammo) non-captured dual recoil springs allowing fine tuning of one or both springs, a slightly stiffer safety mechanism designed to prevent accidental decocking while under stress when releasing the safety in cocked and locked mode, and a brushed stainless barrel top. In mint, like new condition with only about 150 rounds fired. Never carried and only occasionally shot. It was my nightstand gun for many years. Original owner. Comes with the original hard case, 6 13 rd. mags, a generous assortment of expensive, high end self defense ammo (about 450 rds. JHP including HST and Corbon) and about 150 rds. of FMJ practice ammo, and all of the original paperwork. As a bonus, the mags are all pre-ban, making them very valuable to residents of states with state enacted copies of the old ban still in effect (like Massachusetts).  I also have a matching, new Galco Fletch holster made specifically for the USP I'll sell for $75 (cost was ~100).  You must be at least 18, a Florida resident, and legally allowed to purchase and own this firearm. I prefer local FTF, cash, with CWP, but I will ship it to your FFL if you pay shipping. Ammo and gun must ship separately. Payment via cash or USPS money order for non-local sales.
